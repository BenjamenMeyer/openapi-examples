OpenAPI v3 Examples
===================

OpenAPI_ is a specification for describing APIs that can be written in either
JSON or YAML formats. Older version of the specification only supported JSON
format; however, the OpenAPIv3Spec_ also supports YAML which is the preferred
format for this project.

The OpenAPI spec recommends the project use the filename `openapi.yaml` or
`openapi.json` as the initial starting file. The examples might, however,use
`openapi.yml` for consistency with other files here in order to compliment
the examples provided by the OpenAPIv3Spec_ as well as the additional
examples in the SwaggerTools_.
